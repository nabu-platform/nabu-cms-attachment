Internal attachments are those where we store the binary content. This is as opposed to external attachments where the content lives somewhere else and the attachment itself is merely a reference to that.

External attachments are presumed to be publically available so we can just give the URL to the user to resolve, internal attachments have to be resolved by the server and streamed to the user.
